# Mass Downloader (Version 1.0)

## Notes

This is a mass downloader for Drupal 7 and Drupal 10 files. If a file is available (returns a 200 status code), then it will be downloaded into the "downloads" folder. If a file is unavailable (returns a 404 status code), then an error message will be printed to the terminal.

To use the program, copy the links from the spreadsheet and paste it into the "scripts/input.txt" file and click CTRL + S to save the changes. Then, navigate to the "scripts/script.py" file. To run the script file, either type "python scripts/script.py" in the terminal, or navigate to the top right corner and click the play button.
